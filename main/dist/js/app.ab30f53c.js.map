Phluently collects\r\n                        location information when the mobile application is running in the foreground (mobile\r\n                        application open and on-screen) of your device. Phluently may collect this information when the\r\n                        mobile application is running in the background of your device if this collection is enabled\r\n                        through your application settings or device permissions.

A cookie is a piece of data or text file on your computer that identifies you as\r\n                        a unique user. A web beacon is an object that is embedded in a page or email and is usually\r\n                        invisible to the user but allows checking whether a user has viewed the page or email. We use\r\n                        cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar technologies for a number of purposes, including\r\n                        to improve the quality of the Services and to make the Services easier to use. We may combine\r\n                        Usage Data with Personal Information in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an\r\n                        individual user, and may collect, use, preserve and disclose Usage Data in any manner that we\r\n                        may collect, use, preserve and disclose Personal Information as provided herein (whether Usage\r\n                        Data is combined with any Personal Information or otherwise). As more particularly described\r\n                        below in this Privacy Policy, we sometimes use certain third party tools and services to assist us\r\n                        in collecting Usage Data.
